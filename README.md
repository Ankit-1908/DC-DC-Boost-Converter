## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  

1. **PWM Generation:**  
   - A Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) circuit was designed to operate at 7.5 kHz.  
   - The duty cycle was adjusted (around 40%) to achieve the required voltage boost.  

2. **Driver Circuit:**  
   - The driver circuit interfaces the PWM signal with the power MOSFET.  
   - Ensures proper switching and isolation.  

3. **Boost Converter Simulation:**  
   - The converter was simulated using standard power electronics tools (MATLAB/PSIM/Multisim).  
   - Observed inductor current, diode current, and output voltage waveforms in both CCM and DCM.

## üß© Theoretical Overview  

The **Boost Converter** is a type of DC‚ÄìDC converter that steps up the input voltage to a higher level at the output.  

### Operating Modes
- **Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM):**  
  The inductor current never falls to zero during the switching cycle.  
- **Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM):**  
  The inductor current falls to zero before the next switching cycle begins, typically under light-load conditions.
